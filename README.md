# PrimedGun

![PrimedGun gameplay](assets/readme/primedgun-hero.jfif)

PrimedGun is a Dolphin ReduX-based build focused on improving Metroid Prime's VR experience.

## Build - Windows

Use a Visual Studio x64 developer environment, then build the PrimedGun executable. Git, the latest Windows SDK, CMake, and Ninja should be installed.

```bat
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Nobbie248/PrimedGun.git
cd PrimedGun
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake -S . -B build\Release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build\Release --target dolphin-emu
```

The built app is written to `Binary\x64\PrimedGun.exe`.

## Build - Linux Flatpak

The Flatpak package is built from `Flatpak/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu.yml`. The
manifest builds PrimedGun, installs the launcher wrapper, packages the desktop UI
images into `/app/bin/assets`, and seeds the bundled Dolphin settings into the
Flatpak sandbox on first launch.

Install Flatpak Builder and the KDE runtime dependencies, then build from the
repository root:

```bash
flatpak install flathub org.kde.Platform//6.10 org.kde.Sdk//6.10
flatpak-builder --user --force-clean --repo=flatpak-repo flatpak-build Flatpak/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu.yml
flatpak build-bundle flatpak-repo PrimedGun.flatpak org.PrimedGun.PrimedGun
```

Install or replace the local Flatpak bundle with:

```bash
flatpak install --user --reinstall PrimedGun.flatpak
flatpak run org.PrimedGun.PrimedGun
```

Flatpak user files are not written beside the executable. Dolphin's writable
Flatpak folders are:

- Config and INI files: `~/.var/app/org.PrimedGun.PrimedGun/config/dolphin-emu/`
- User data, game settings, textures, resource packs, and memory cards:
  `~/.var/app/org.PrimedGun.PrimedGun/data/dolphin-emu/`

On first launch, `Flatpak/dolphin-emu-wrapper` copies the bundled defaults from
`/app/share/dolphin-emu/User` into those writable folders. Config, GameSettings,
and GameSettingsVR are applied so the included PrimedGun defaults take effect.
The wrapper also patches the Linux sandbox settings to use the Vulkan graphics
backend and keeps the bundled cannon texture library available under
`Load/PrimedGun/CannonTextures`. Save data folders such as `GC` are copied
without overwriting existing files.

Existing Flatpak installs are migrated with a versioned seed marker, so updated
defaults can be applied after a package update without requiring users to delete
their whole sandbox.

If an older broken Flatpak already created bad default settings, reinstalling the
bundle may not be enough. To force a clean Flatpak sandbox, run:

```bash
flatpak uninstall --delete-data org.PrimedGun.PrimedGun
flatpak install --user PrimedGun.flatpak
```

This deletes the Flatpak sandbox data for PrimedGun, including saves and local
settings, so back up memory cards first if needed.
