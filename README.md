# PrimedGun

Dolphin OpenXR-side VR enhancement mod for Metroid Prime running in Dolphin.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- CMake 3.16+
- A C++ compiler toolchain
- OpenXR SDK headers at `C:\OpenXR-SDK`
- Dolphin running Metroid Prime GCN NTSC Rev 0 (`GM8E01`)
(built and tested with Dolphin-OpenXR 2512-421 -dirty)

## Build

```bat
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Nobbie248/PrimedGun.git
cd PrimedGun
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Runtime Files

For distribution/share, the useful files are:

- `PrimedGun.exe`
- `PrimedGun_DolphinHook.dll`
- `libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`
- `libstdc++-6.dll`
- `libwinpthread-1.dll`
- `primedgun_settings.ini`

## Features

- Full directional movement.
- Offhand controller yaw controls directional strafing.
- Visor hand gesture input: the app reads the control stick as visor D-pad input when the controller is near your head.
- Improved gun-based lock/scan targeting.
- VR arm cannon tracking through Dolphin-side OpenXR.
- Dolphin-side hook bridge for app-owned game patches and diagnostics.

## Usage

1. Launch `PrimedGun.exe`.
2. Load Metroid Prime in Dolphin.
3. PrimedGun will check then start.
4. While in game click the right thumb stick to center view with arm cannon correctly.

## Notes

- Settings are saved to `primedgun_settings.ini`.
- PrimedGun currently expects Dolphin's user config at `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\...` for temporary controller/hotkey setup.
- The app reads controller tracking from Dolphin-side OpenXR and writes the cannon transform into Dolphin memory.
- PrimedGun should be running before Metroid Prime is loaded so the Dolphin-side hook is ready as soon as GM8E01 memory appears.
- For the best experience, try not to turn your body around. You can move in the game like this, but functionality is not ideal.
